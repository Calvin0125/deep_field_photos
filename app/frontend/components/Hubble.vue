  <p>The Hubble Deep Field Photo, taken in 1995, was a groundbreaking image that captured a tiny,
    seemingly empty patch of sky over the course of 10 consecutive days. What emerged from this deep
    exposure was a stunning array of over 3,000 galaxies, some of the most distant and ancient ever seen
    at the time. The photo demonstrated Hubble's remarkable capacity to look far into space and time,
    fundamentally changing our understanding of the universe.</p>
