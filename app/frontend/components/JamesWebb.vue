  <p>The James Webb Deep Field Photo represents the most detailed image of the early universe ever captured.
     Taken using the James Webb Space Telescopeâ€™s powerful infrared capabilities, it allows us to see galaxies
     that existed over 13 billion years ago, just a few hundred million years after the Big Bang. Launched in
     2021, Webb's ability to peer through cosmic dust and capture faint light gives scientists an unprecedented
     view into the formation of the first galaxies.</p>
